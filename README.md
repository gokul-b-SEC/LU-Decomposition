# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
Step 1:
Start the program.

Step 2:
Import the required library (NumPy).

Step 3:
Input the elements of the matrix and store them in a 2D array.

Step 4:
End the Program.

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
